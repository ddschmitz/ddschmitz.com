                        Dakota State University is an absolutely amazing institution. I enjoyed my time there tremendously while at the same time building a great amount of respect for the faculty.  While there I received my bachelor’s in Computer and Network Security.  You can think of this degree as a computer science degree with a big emphasis on security.  I took a lot of the classes that a comp. sci. student would take such data structures, object oriented programming, and language processing.  But in addition to those, I also took classes focused more on security such as offensive and defensive network security, web software security, and malware analysis. (<b>Pertaining to the link above;</b> the program for B.S. in Computer and Network Security changed to Cyber Ops in 2014)

                        I was also able to complete my master's degree at DSU which was in Applied Computer Science.  The MSACS degree is essentially just a computer science degree, however they had to add the applied part to it in order to get it accepted by the South Dakota Board of Reagents.  Other than that it has all the same classes as a comp. sci. degree at a different school (download my unofficial transcript below to see for yourself!).

                        The following summer after graduating from high school, I enrolled at Northwest Iowa Community College.  However I wasn't happy with the education I was getting there.  I had heard about Dakota State University's curriculum and it sounded better, so after one semester I decided to transfer schools. (<b>Pertaining to the link above;</b> The program for A.S. in Computer Science and Networking has changed since I left. )

Representing DSU was two teams of four, one of which I was a member of.  The competition consisted of three sections: short coding problems, word problems, and long coding problems.  Teams were given one computer with various software installed to complete the challenges.  Our team utilized Java and Python to complete the problems.

                        CCDC is a defensive security competition comprised of teams from various colleges throughout the nation. Teams are given identical networks and tasked with their defense. The intent of these networks is to simulate a real business network. As you attempt to secure your network, a group of security professionals actively attempts to breach your network.
