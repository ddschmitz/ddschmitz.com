            <h2 class="Tmn8SubHead">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! This section of my website is going to be dedicated solely to documenting and showcasing the work I put into my 2003 Mustang Cobra.  Here you will find a detailed list of all the modifications and repairs I have made to my originally stock Cobra.  Results of the various dyno runs my car has made, as well as a photo gallery.  I love everything about this car and not a day goes by where owning it doesn't make me happy, and I hope I can show that adequately in this section!</p>
            <h2 class="Tmn8SubHead">How my interest in cars began</h2>
            <p>Growing up through most of high school I never really had a strong interest in cars or being a mechanic, I just used them as a means to get me places.  Then starting around my last year of high school I started watching a lot of the British version of Top Gear.  The show combined great humor and amazing cinematography while showcasing hundreds of different cars from old junkers all the way up to multi-million dollar vehicles.  This is where my interest in cars really took off but I didn't have one yet that I could call my own.  </p>
            <p>When I was 19 I got a job as a car detailer at a dealership my mom worked at.  One day someone bought a car and traded in a 2001 Mustang GT.  I instantly fell in love with the car.  It had an aftermarket body kit and exhaust system and looked and sounded great!  It wasn't too much over the top, just the right amount of awesome.  My parents ended up helping me get it and this is where my interest in mustangs started to grow. </p>
            <p>It wasn't until I was 21 that I started learning about Terminators (the nickname given to 03/04 Cobras) and their history.  My interest in the car grew tremendously with every video and every article I read about them.   I eventually realized that this was my dream car (which was great because Terminators are relatively cheap to purchase, cheap to maintain, and have the potential to output A LOT of power).  So I began my search for the perfect Terminator for me.  Through my searching, I came to realize that these cars have a huge cult following and very few of them have gone unmodified.  This made my search difficult because I really wanted a stock Terminator that I could work on and modify with my brother.  Eventually luck struck me and I found a stock 2003 Dark Shadow Gray Mustang Cobra in Illinois with 34,XXX miles.  Without much hesitation I pulled the trigger and purchased my very own Terminator!</p>
