            <p>I got my first desktop computer in August of 2010 as a gift from my parents (shown above).  I used it for just about everything from school work to playing games.  It worked well and suited my needs adequately.  However, like all computers, the years took a toll on it and soon it started having some hiccups.  It wasn't until the summer of 2014 that I started to get hard drive troubles and without any upgrades since I got it, it was starting to become out of date in my eyes.  This was also the year that I was awarded the Cyber Corps scholarship and now had some extra spending money from my summer internship with Citibank.  So coupled with those three things, I thought it would be a great time to build myself a new computer for the first time!</p>
            <p>Well, after I had built my new computer, I realized I had no use for my old one.  So rather than just getting rid of it, I thought I'd repurpose it and let it be our family computer at my parents' house.  My plan for our new family computer was to replace the old 250GB hard drive that was going bad with a new 1TB hard drive.  In addition to the new hard drive, I also wanted the new operating system for the computer to be something other than Windows. </p>

            <p id="Proj3SmallP">I'm aware of the atrocious cable management but the power supply isn't modular and there's no room to route the cables behind the motherboard tray.</p>
            <p>I began my project by giving the internals of the tower a good dusting.  While dusting and removing the old hard drive, I took the CPU fan off for cleaning and noticed the thermal compound was almost bone dry. I decided now was as good a time as any to replace the CPU fan and get some new thermal paste.  The fan I went with was a MASSCOOL 90mm CPU Cooler.</p>

            <p>As for the hard drive, I replaced the old Seagate 250GB Barracuda with a WD Blue 1TB.  I also decided that I wanted to use Ubuntu 14.04.2 as the operating system.  I was really excited to use Ubuntu since this would be the first time I've ever used a Linux based operating system for personal use. </p>
