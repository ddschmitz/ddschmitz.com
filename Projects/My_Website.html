            <p>I began working on this website in April of 2015.  As part of my Web Application Programming II class (CIS - 375), we had to create a final project.  This final project was to create a new website using a number of different topics we were taught throughout the semester. These topics included master pages, server controls, and session state to name a few. </p>
            <p>I had been playing with the thought of making my own online portfolio for a while and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to make that happen.  There were three major goals I had in mind when developing my website.</p>
            <ol class="EmplList">
                <li>Showcase my strengths and accomplishments to future employers</li>
                <li>Easy to use.  Such as navigating the site and viewing the content. </li>
                <li>Be somewhat visually pleasing.  I had made other websites in the past for class assignments and would always struggle with this aspect. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the end I was extremely satisfied with the way my website turned out.  I feel it is a great way to showcase my strengths and accomplishments.  I was able to find a free template online for a navigation bar that works perfectly to fit the needs of my website.  Also by using help online, I was able to find a free background pattern and color scheme to match.  In addition to the background and color scheme, I was able to find some free tools that also helped enhance my website.  These tools are <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" target="_blank" class="Proj1Links">Lightbox</a> and <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target="_blank" class="Proj1Links">Syntax Highlighter</a> which can be seen on this page and the page for my SuperAssemBros project respectively. </p>
