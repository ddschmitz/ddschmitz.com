                I began working on this website in April of 2015.  As part of my Web Application Programming II class (CIS - 375), we had to create a final project.  This final project was to create a new website using a number of different topics we were taught throughout the semester. These topics included master pages, server controls, and session state to name a few. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I had been playing with the thought of making my own online portfolio for a while and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to make that happen.  There were three major goals I had in mind when developing my website.
                </p>

                <ol class="DS-list">
                    <li>Showcase my strengths and accomplishments to future employers</li>
                    <li>Easy to use.  Such as navigating the site and viewing the content. </li>
                    <li>Be somewhat visually pleasing.  I had made other websites in the past for class assignments and would always struggle with this aspect. </li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>
                In the end I was extremely satisfied with the way my website turned out.  I feel it is a great way to showcase my strengths and accomplishments.  It has also been a great way for me to get involved with open source projects and finding different ones to incorporate into my website.  The ones that I'm currently using include:
                </p>

                <ul class="DS-list">
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2" style="text-decoration:none; color:#C5BD99;">Lightbox</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                Around May of 2016 I made some significant changes to my website.  During CIS – 375, we did all of our assignments and developed our project websites with ASP.NET. I had also always wanted to host my website myself and I learned pretty quickly that this may not be as easy as I had hoped since my website was written with ASP.NET. I started looking into different options such as the Mono Project as a way of hosting my website on a Linux box.  They all seemed much more complicated solutions than what I was looking for since my website was such a small and simple one.  I eventually came up with the perfect solution for what I wanted to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                The solution I came up with involved cloning my current website using the GNU software package Wget.  When Wget finishes cloning your website, you are left with a folder containing an exact copy of your website, only instead of having .aspx files you have .html.  After cleaning up some minor bugs in the website, I had a perfectly functional version of my website that I could easily host myself.  I used <a href="https://namecheap.com/" style="text-decoration:none; color:#C5BD99;">Namecheap</a> to register my domain and point it to my Linux server which I set up using <a href="https://vultr.com/" style="text-decoration:none; color:#C5BD99;">Vultr</a>.  For only $5/month I am able to host my own website using a virtual server that I have full control over!
