            <p>The first modification that was ever made to my car was swapping the stock 3.55 gears with 4.10s.  This was by no means the first mod I had planned for the car but we had some special circumstances, so it just happened to be.  We had to replace the rear differential bearings because they were going bad, so while we were doing that my brother suggested we change the gears as well.  I was surprised at how long and difficult of a process this is on a car with independent rear suspension as opposed to one with a solid rear axle. </p>

            <p>	This was the first time I had ever seen the inside of a differential.  I always understood the concept of how and what they do but finally seeing it in person gave me a better idea of what actually goes on in there. </p>
