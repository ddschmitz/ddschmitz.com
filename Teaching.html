                <p><b>Catalog description for Computer Science I (CSC-150):</b> An introduction to computer programming. Focus on problem solving, algorithm development, design, and programming concepts. Topics include sequence, selection, repetition, functions, and arrays.</p>

            <div class="Simple_P">
                <p>Starting in the spring of 2016, I was offered the position of Adjunct Instructor at Dakota State University. The class that I was hired to teach was Computer Science I (CSC-150). This class served as a dual purpose course at DSU.  It was an institutional graduation requirement which meant that it was a required class to graduate by all majors (students could choose to take CSC-150 or an equivalent class to fulfill the requirement).  In addition to being a required class by all majors, it was also the first programming course for majors such as Computer Science, Cyber Operations, Game Design, and many more.  </p>
                <p>CSC-150 was the introductory programming course offered at DSU and was taught in C.  The course introduced students to many basic programming concepts such as functions, arrays, and control flow. However, in addition to these programming concepts, the course also taught another valuable skill in which even the students who weren’t pursuing tech related majors could benefit from, and this was problem solving.</p>
                <p>I am extremely grateful to have been allowed the opportunity to teach an entire course by myself at a state university. Not only did I get to teach incoming students and help build their interest in programming, I learned a tremendous amount myself.  While developing my lesson plans and lectures, I learned a bunch of things about C that I had never known before.  I developed a greater appreciation for the language and increased my desire to write more programs with it as well as to learn more about programming concepts in general.  Another great skill I learned, was how to present a topic that was new to a group, in a way that they can understand and learn from.  This was the most challenging part of teaching, making sure that what I was saying and teaching, was being understood by the students.   </p>
