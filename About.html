                        I was born and raised on a farm outside of Brewster, Minnesota.  Growing up I always remember there being a computer in our house and it would change brands over the years.  However up until I graduated high school, the only thing I ever used it for was playing games and browsing the internet.

                    <p class="DS-paragraph-box-about">
                        Then came graduation and I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do with my life.  At first I wanted to be an airplane mechanic but that didn't last long since I realized I had no knowledge of engines whatsoever.  I then realized hey, I already enjoy using computers and want to know more about how they work, why not go to school for something computer related?  And that's exactly what I did!

                        Outside of academia and work, I have a wide variety of interests but there are a few that stick out, number one being music. However that being said I find it very difficult to sum up my musical interests in one word or genre.  I really enjoy anything from Nirvana, to The Wonder Years, to bands such as Meshuggah.  Just recently (April '15) I decided to start learning how to play the guitar.  My desire to begin playing stemmed from the fact that nearly every song by every band I liked had at the minimum a guitarist, bassist, and drummer.  So I started learning songs so I could finally play along rather than just play the air guitar.

                    <p class="DS-paragraph-box-about">
                        In addition to music I also really enjoy movies.  Some of my favorites include Fight Club, The Matrix, and Interstellar.  Weight lifting and keeping myself physically fit through sports is another thing I enjoy doing in my free time.
